To run Freelit:

1. navigate to Group-15 folder in a terminal
2. ensure you have a .env file for the server to use (I am not allowed to provide ours for security reasons) in this folder
3. run 'node ./project/Back-end/appServer.js
4. click the localhost link provided in the terminal
5. a browser should have opened with Freelit active on it
