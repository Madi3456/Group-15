<h4>Test Mode</h4>
    <p>This feature allows student's to test their skills. The students will be given a choice to be tested on description or definition. This will then create a mock test with the descriptions or definitions to which the user will input the definition given testing description or description given testing description. After the student fills in their answers they can then see their score and what questions they got wrong and right. The student then can have the option to take the test with the answers they got wrong to try and get closer to 100 or restart the test to get a new score not dependent on the old one.
