<h4>User Needs</h4>
<p>Student's often face the pressure of juggling multiple assignments, quizzes, tests of many different classes and make use of flash cards to quickly revise and stay on top of their class materials.

Not only do we help with flash cards but also practice tests which would help students feel more prepared and confident for their upcoming tests. </p>
<p>Another very important need for students is for resources like Freelit to be accessible and affordible. </p>
<h4>Why This Matters</h4>
<p>Alot of times students get overwhelmed with the pressure of staying on track with their coursework and performing well.

By providing an easy and accessibly platform for students to study and stay organised, we enable them to be more efficent and prepared. Additionally, students already pay hundreds of dollars for their books and tuition and do not need another additional liability which is why Freelit is completely free of cost.</p>
