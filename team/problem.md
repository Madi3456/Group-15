<h4>Group 15:Freelit boost for free eduction</h4>
<h4>Problem Description</h4>
<p>There is a lot of sites used by student's such as Quizlet that used to be free to access that has now been put behind paywalls. This had made it harder for those who we're using these study tools to access and cut off a large student demographic from theses necessary resources. We believe that study tools should be free and open to all backrounds regardless of financial situations.</p> 
<h4>Problem solution</h4>
<p>To solve this we'd like to take the core original ideas of the site Quizlet and keep them alive before they turned into a payed walled site. With out new website we wish to offer the ability for student's to make flash cards to practice with as well as tests to strengthen their memorization. All of this free for all student's to be able to be free through free education.</p>
<h4>Why Freelit Matters</h4>
<p>We believe eduction and learning doesn't belong behind a pay wall and should be open for everyone regardless of financial situation. With this we hope to help all student's learn faster and more efficiently through our services. We hope this improves our users lives by giving them a faster more efficient and fun way to study but most of all free. We believe that eduction is Freedom so we wish to open this opportunity to have freedom for all. </p>
