<h4>Group 15: Freelit boost for free eduction</h4>
<p>Problem Description: As students, we heavely rely on sites such as Quizlet to study and revise for exams. These sites that once used to be free to access, have unfortunately now been put behind paywalls. This has made these necessary resources highly inaccessible and even cut off a large student demographic. We truly believe that study tools should be free and open to all backrounds regardless of financial backgrounds to ensure equal accessibilty of education for all. <br> 
Problem solution: To address this problem faced by many including us, we would like to create our own platform that takes inspiration from the core original ideas of the site Quizlet and is absolutely free of cost. Our website will allow students to create flashcards and take quizzes to improve memorization and learning. By offering these essential tools for free, we hope to make education more accessible by providing an open educational resource for all students.<br>
Why Freelit Matters: We believe eduction is a right and learning doesn't belong behind a pay wall. With Freelit we aim to improve our users study experience by giving them a faster more efficient and fun way to study but most of all free. Eduction is Freedom and we wish to open this opportunity to have freedom for all. </p>
