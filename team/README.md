Our project, Freelet, is a free version of quizlet that provides students with all of their studying needs for free! Freelet uses a server which 
can be opened through the initial page(initial-page.html) to open our project. You will first be prompted to either login or signup. Using the database we created, we 
can verify a students' login information, let a new member know if their username is already taken or that they have already signed up. Once you are 
logged in,you will land at our homepage. There are then multiple buttons that can be used to navagate to the subjects page, a testing page, a study 
guides page, a flashcards page and test history. The tests page will tests users based on study sets of their choice. The results of those tests
can then be located in the test history page. In the subjects page, there are catergories under which a user can find all studysets in that catergory.
Under the study guides page, you can create and name a studyset which will be saved to our database. You can then review this set as flashcards.
